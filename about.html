        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Y Combinator is an American seed accelerator launched in March 2005 and has been 
        used to launch over 2,000 companies including Stripe, Airbnb, Cruise Automation, 
        DoorDash, Coinbase, Instacart, and Dropbox. The combined valuation of the top YC 
        companies was over $155 Billion as of October, 2019. </p>

        <p> Y Combinator was founded in 2005 by Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell and 
            Robert Tappan Morris.
            From 2005 to 2008, one program was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and one was held in 
            Mountain View, California. As Y Combinator grew to 40 investments per year, running two 
            programs became too much. In January 2009, Y Combinator announced that the Cambridge program 
            would be closed and all future programs would take place in Silicon Valley.
            In 2014, founder Paul Graham announced he was stepping down and that Sam Altman would take 
            over as President of Y Combinator. That same year, Altman announced "The New Deal" for YC 
            startups, which offers $120,000 for 7% equity.
            Y Combinator interviews and selects two or more batches of companies per year. The companies 
            receive seed money, advice, and connections in exchange for 7% equity of the company. 
            The program includes "office hours", where startup founders meet individually and group 
            meetings. Founders also participate in weekly dinners where guests from the Silicon Valley 
            ecosystem (successful entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, etc.) speak to the founders.
            Y Combinatorâ€™s motto is "Make Something People Want." The program teaches founders to market 
            their product, team and market, refining their business model, achieving product/market fit, 
            and scaling the startup into a high growth business, etc. The program ends with Demo Day, 
            where startups present their business and sometimes technology to potential investors. </p>
